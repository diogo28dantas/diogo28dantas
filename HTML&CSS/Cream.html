Cream is a clothing brand founded in 2004 that celebrates femininity and embodies a chic signature style with a Scandinavian touch. Renowned for its distinctive bohemian look, Cream captures a unique blend of timeless elegance and contemporary trends.<br/>
<br/>During my internship at Uncle Grey, I took part in reshaping Cream’s identity. Formerly esteemed with a clear identity and widespread appeal, the mission was to revive its essence. My contribution was primarily focused on the early stages, where I was tasked with presenting a visually updated identity that included a new logo and simplified symbol. The aim was to evolve from the existing one, while still maintaining a fresh and classic vibe that could resonate with a younger audience.
