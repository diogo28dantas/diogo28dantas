Riot Fest is a groundbreaking, multi-genre festival designed to disrupt the ‘quiet’ with its diverse crowd and artist lineup. Set to unfold at Refshaleøen in Copenhagen, this open-air festival features a huge range of genres, going from R&B and Neo Soul to Hip Hop and AfroPop, creating an energetic and inclusive atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>Conceived as a fictional three-day event, the goal with Riot Fest was to redefine the traditional festival experience, creating a loud and uncontrolled celebration of music and entertainment, reminiscent of a riot. By curating a lineup that reflects a spectrum of musical styles, the aim was to captivate and entertain a broad audience, with diversity, energy and extravagance at the heart of the Riot Fest experience.
